See the awesome contracts and applications that people are building with RadiantScript!

## AnyHedge

AnyHedge is the first DeFi project built on top of Radiant in the form of a synthetic derivatives platform. AnyHedge allows any two parties to enter into a smart contract together and speculate on the future price of an asset. One of the parties wishes to protect themselves against price fluctuations and takes the *hedge* position, while the other party wishes to speculate and takes a leveraged *long* position.
