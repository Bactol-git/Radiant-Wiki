# How collaborate with this wiki

To collaborate and propose articles will be very simple with the Wiki system created for Radiant. Only articles with a minimum of quality and coherence will be accepted. In Discord you can discuss proposals for articles.

1. Have a GitHub account. 
2. Make a Fork of the [Radiant Wiki](https://github.com/RadiantBlockchain-Community).
3. Create or Modify the proposal in MarkDown format: [https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)
4. Propose the above changes by making a pull request to the original code.

In the review there can be several states: Acceptance, Request for changes, doubts, non-acceptance. In the comments of the proposal all the information will be included.
